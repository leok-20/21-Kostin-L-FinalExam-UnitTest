1. Creating a brand new Junit tester class & creating tons of test methods 1,2,3,etc...

2. In each of those test methods we should expect to test our brand new extensions, along with any previous comparisons that it might give as an output.

3. Implement assertFail for both negative number & greater than 1000, but making sure that one will have IllegalOutOfBounds (greater than 1000) while the other will have IllegalArgumentException (negative nums).
